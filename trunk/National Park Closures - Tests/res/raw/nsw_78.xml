  <description><![CDATA[<strong>CLOSED AREAS</strong><br /><strong>Some Fire Trails not suitable for trailer access</strong><br />NPWS has identified five trails within Deua National Park that are unsuitable for all trailer access, due to the current and increasing cost of road and trail maintenance.  This is because of damage to trail drainage structures from the use (or inappropriate use) of 4WDs towing trailers and wheel skidding on steeper sections of trail, lack of traction <span class="GramE">in</span> wet weather, and towing and winching activities in recovery of stranded vehicles.<br/>
The NPWS asks that you keep all trailers away from these identified trails. By doing this you reduce the <span class="GramE">safety risk to yourself and others, reduce</span> damage to the park environment and your assets, and reduce park maintenance costs – a benefit for us and for you.<br/>
These five trails are: Dampier Mountain Fire Trail, Minuma Range Fire Trail, Mongamula Fire Trail, Merricumbene Fire Trail, and Dry Creek Fire Trail. These trails have been sign-posted to show they are not suitable for trailers.<br/>
Alternative trailer access to Bendethera camping area is available from Moruya via Little Sugarloaf Road and Bendethera Fire Trail. From Braidwood, this increases travel time by about ½ to 1 hour.<br/>

  <description><![CDATA[<strong>HAZARD REDUCTION BURNS</strong><br /><strong>Hazard reduction burn</strong><br />The National Parks & Wildlife Service and the Rural Fire Service are proposing to undertake a hazard reduction burn on the south-western ridge of Gulguer Nature Reserve, Greendale.  <br/>
At this point in time the proposed date will be Thursday 19th April. It should be emphasised that the exact timing of the burn is dependent upon forecast weather conditions and subsequently may be postponed if conditions are not favourable. It there is a need to reschedule it is likely to be within a 6-8 week period.<br/>
On the day of the burn it is suggested that in order to minimise smoke disruption to your home, you close windows and doors, remove washing from your clothesline, secure domestic pets and retract pool covers to prevent ember damage, etc.<br/>
During the burn sections of the park, tracks and trails will be closed to the public.<br/>
Should you require any further information contact the Cumberland South Area office on 47748662.<br />]]></description>

Park fire bans are imposed by NPWS managers for a particular park or reserve.<br/>
When a park fire ban is in place, you can't light a fire using solid fuels such as timber, charcoal or heat beads. However, the use of gas-fired and electrical appliances may be permitted for cooking where:<br/>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the appliance is under the direct control of an adult;</li>
<li>the appliance is placed or located in an area where there is no combustible material within three metres; and</li>
<li>there is an adequate water supply to extinguish fire adjacent to the appliances.</li>
</ul>

  <description><![CDATA[<strong>CLOSED AREAS</strong><br /><strong>Stoney Creek Road partially closed due to poor condition</strong><br />Stoney Creek Road Wootton is closed due to poor surface condition. The recent wet weather has resulted in slippery conditions, as the road had just been graded. The closure will help to reduce damage to the road surface and assist with public safety. The section of road affected is from The Grandis west to the park boundary. This effectively closes Stoney Creek Road from the Grandis to the Old Pacific Highway (Wootton Way) Park neighbours will have access to their properties. The closure will remain in place until the road surface dries out. For more information please contact the Great Lakes Area Office on 02 6591 0300<br />

  <description><![CDATA[<strong>CLOSED AREAS</strong><br /><strong>Short term closure of "The Towers" due to Peregrine falcon nesting
                    (Ends  Monday 31 December)
                  </strong><br />It has been decided to close the rock climbing and abseiling wall locally known as “The Towers”, within The Rock Nature Reserve. 

This closure will be in place until the 31st of December 2012. Peregrine falcons have now started to nest within the rock sports area and evidence suggests that the abandonment of peregrine falcon nesting sites can occur as a result of the presence of rock climbers, especially during the early stages of nesting. This is different to previous years, where Peregrine falcons were observed nesting at the reserve on the south-east rock face, which is approximately 1km from where rock sports are allowed to occur.

If you have any questions please call the Murray Area Office between Monday and Friday, 9am - 4pm 03 54839100.<br />]]></description>
