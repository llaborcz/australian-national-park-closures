## Welcome to the home page of the Australian National Park closure and Fire Incident application ##
This is an android application that shows information about national park closures in various states in Australia (The progressive ones that have made consumable data feeds available).  It also shows information about fire incidents throughout Australia - again based on consumable data feeds.

In the case where the data feeds contain geographical information those closures and incidents are displayed using a built in MapView.

The current state (10 Nov) is that information about closures in NSW and QLD is shown. Fire information from Western Australia is also shown. The next phase of the project will be to add fire information from NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and other states that make fire information available using data feeds.
